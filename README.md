Simple script to install meshmixer 2.9 on Ubuntu 16 and clean up the library version dependencies. Meshmixer will be installed in a directory called meshmixer in the current directory you run the script in, but all the updated library search paths will be relative so you can move the directory anywhere once it has been created. If you move it then you will need to update the symbolic link /usr/bin/meshmixer to point to the new location.
